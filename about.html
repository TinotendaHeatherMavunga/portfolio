<p> Heather Tinotenda Mavunga is currently an entrepreneur in training at the Meltwater School of Entrepreneurial Technology in Accra,Ghana.The Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) is a non-profit post-graduate training and mentoring program and startup incubator in Accra, Ghana.The three-phase school and incubator program were founded in 2008 by JÃ¸rn Lyseggen to provide training, investment, and mentoring for aspiring technology entrepreneurs with the goal of creating globally successful companies that create wealth and jobs locally in Africa.</p>

<p>Since launching in 2008, MEST backed startups have been acquired by investors, or recognized internationally by organisations such as Techstars, 500 Startups, Y-Combinator and at events like the LAUNCH Conference in San Francisco.Previously, I was a digital media practitioner who worked in the digital advertising industry in Johannesburg.I am also a proud alumni of the highly acclaimed training program Digify Pro,which is a digital training initiative delivered by Livity Africa, with support from Google, the Rockefeller Foundation and the British Council.
 </p>

<p>When I look to the future, I face it with the strong conviction that Africa's growth in the future, will be driven by millennials passionate about social change technology that promote unique African solutions to unique African challenges.</p>
